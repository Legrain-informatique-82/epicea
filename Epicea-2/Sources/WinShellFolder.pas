{ SHGetFolderPath

  Takes the CSIDL of a folder and returns the path.

  Parameters :

    hwndOwner [i] Handle to an owner window. This parameter is typically set to NULL. If it is not NULL,
                  and a dial-up connection needs to be made to access the folder, a user interface (UI) prompt
                  will appear in this window.
    nFolder   [i] A CSIDL value that identifies the folder whose path is to be retrieved. Only real folders are valid.
                  If a virtual folder is specified, this function will fail. You can force creation of a folder with
                  SHGetFolderPath by combining the folder's CSIDL with CSIDL_FLAG_CREATE.
    hToken    [i] An access token that can be used to represent a particular user. For systems earlier than
                  Microsoft Windows 2000, it should be set to NULL. For later systems, hToken is usually set to NULL.
                  However, you may need to assign a value to hToken for those folders that can have multiple users but
                  are treated as belonging to a single user. The most commonly used folder of this type is Documents.

                  The caller is responsible for correct impersonation when hToken is non-NULL. It must have appropriate
                  security privileges for the particular user, including TOKEN_QUERY and TOKEN_IMPERSONATE, and the
                  user's registry hive must be currently mounted. See Access Control for further discussion of access
                  control issues.

                  Assigning the hToken parameter a value of -1 indicates the Default User. This allows clients of
                  SHGetFolderPath to find folder locations (such as the Desktop folder) for the Default User. The
                  Default User user profile is duplicated when any new user account is created, and includes special
                  folders such as My Documents and Desktop. Any items added to the Default User folder also appear in
                  any new user account.

    dwFlags   [i] Flags to specify which path is to be returned. It is used for cases where the folder associated with
                  a CSIDL may be moved or renamed by the user.
                      SHGFP_TYPE_CURRENT  Return the folder's current path.
                      SHGFP_TYPE_DEFAULT  Return the folder's default path.
    pszPath   [o] Pointer to a null-terminated string of length MAX_PATH which will receive the path. If an error
                  occurs or S_FALSE is returned, this string will be empty.

  Return Value :
    Returns standard HRESULT codes, including the following:
        S_FALSE        SHGetFolderPathA only. The CSIDL in nFolder is valid, but the folder does not exist.
                       Note : that the failure code is different for the ANSI and Unicode versions of this function.
        E_FAIL         SHGetFolderPathW only. The CSIDL in nFolder is valid, but the folder does not exist.
                       Note : that the failure code is different for the ANSI and Unicode versions of this function.
        E_INVALIDARG   The CSIDL in nFolder is not valid.


  Remarks :
    This function is a superset of SHGetSpecialFolderPath, included with earlier versions of the Shell. On systems
    preceeding those including Shell32.dll version 5.0 (Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me) and Windows 2000),
    SHGetFolderPath was obtained through SHFolder.dll, distributed with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and later
    versions. SHFolder.dll always calls the current platform's version of this function. If that fails, it will try to
    simulate the appropriate behavior. SHFolder.dll continues to be included for backward compatibility, though the
    function is now implemented in Shell32.dll.

    Note : On older systems that require the redistributable SHFolder.dll, you must explicitly link to SHFolder.lib
    before you link to Shell32.lib.

{ Delphi simplified SHGetFolderPath }
function GetFolderPath(AFolderCSIDL: Integer) : string;
function TryGetFolderPath(AFolderCSIDL: Integer; var Path: string): boolean;

{ SHGetFolderPathAndSubDir

  Accepts the CSIDL of a folder and returns the path to that directory, appending a user-provided subdirectory path.

  Parameters :
    hwnd      [i] Handle to an owner window. This parameter is typically set to NULL. If it is not NULL, and a
                  dial-up connection needs to be made to access the folder, a user interface (UI) prompt appears
                  in this window.
    csidl     [i] A CSIDL value that identifies the folder whose path is to be retrieved. Only real folders are valid.
                  If a virtual folder is specified, this function fails. You can force creation of a folder with
                  SHGetFolderPathAndSubDir by combining the folder's CSIDL with CSIDL_FLAG_CREATE.
    hToken    [i] An access token that you can use to represent a particular user. For systems earlier than
                  Microsoft Windows 2000, set it to NULL. For later systems, hToken is usually, but not always, set
                  to NULL. You might need to assign a value to hToken for those folders that can have multiple users
                  but are treated as belonging to a single user. The most commonly used folder of this type is
                  My Documents.
    dwFlags   [i] A flag to specify whether the path to be returned is the actual path or the default path. It is
                  used in cases where the folder associated with a CSIDL value may be moved or renamed by the user.
                      SHGFP_TYPE_CURRENT  Return the folder's current path.
                      SHGFP_TYPE_DEFAULT  Return the folder's default path.
    pszSubDir [i] Pointer to a null-terminated string of length MAX_PATH that contains the subpath to be appended to
                  the folder's path. If you are not creating a new directory, this must be an existing subdirectory or
                  the function returns an error.
    pszPath   [o] Pointer to a null-terminated string of length MAX_PATH that receives the directory path and appended
                  subpath. This string is empty when the function returns an error code or S_FALSE.

  Return Value :
    Returns a standard OLE-defined error result or one of the following values.
        S_OK          Success.
        S_FALSE       The CSIDL value in csidl is valid, but the folder (including the appended subdirectory)
                      does not exist.
        E_INVALIDARG  The CSIDL value in csidl is not valid.

{ SHGetSpecialFolderPath

  Retrieves the path of a special folder, identified by its CSIDL.

  Parameters :
    hwndOwner [i] Reserved, Handle to the owner window the client should specify if it displays a dialog box or
                  message box.
    lpszPath  [o] Pointer to a null-terminated string that receives the drive and path of the specified folder. This
                  buffer must be at least MAX_PATH characters in size.
    nFolder   [i] A CSIDL that identifies the folder of interest. If a virtual folder is specified, this function
                  will fail.
    fCreate   [i] Indicates if the folder should be created if it does not already exist. If this value is nonzero,
                  the folder will be created. If this value is zero, the folder will not be created.

  Return Value :
    Returns TRUE if successful, or FALSE otherwise.

  Remarks :
    The Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 Desktop Update must be installed for this function to be available.
    With Microsoft Windows 2000, this function is superseded by ShGetFolderPath. You can use this function on
    earlier systems by including the redistributable DLL, ShFolder.dll.
