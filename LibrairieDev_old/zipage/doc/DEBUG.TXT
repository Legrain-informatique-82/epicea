
A note on debugging your application using TZipMaster:


If there's anything wrong with your event handler procedures,
you may get an error message from Windows saying something
is wrong with one of the DLLs.


This is because the DLLs become the "active program" when they
are busy, and your event handlers are "slave" functions/procedures.
Any serious errors in your event handlers will be reported as 
problems with the "active program", which is the DLL.


Don't forget that you can trace through the DLLs using TZipMaster's
"Trace" property.  "Trace" reports progress messages through your
OnMessage event handler.  This is a very handy option.

Fatal errors from Windows normally appear in the center of your
screen.  If you are tracing, and you get a fatal error, you will
not be able to scroll your trace memo.  Also, you won't be able
to move the Windows, and they will all close when you dismiss the
Windows fatal error.  So, you should put your trace Window in the
upper right part of your screen, and set it to "poDesigned".  This
will let you see what is in the Window in case a fatal error occurs.


NT Debug Anomaly: 

Under Windows NT, if you run your application from the IDE,
it will sometimes stop as if you had a breakpoint set.  You
may see an error concerning the RTL heap.  This seems to
be caused by a difference between Microsoft's Runtime Library
and Borland's, but this is just a guess.

I don't know how to prevent this, but there is no problem in
running your application outside of the IDE.  If anyone figures
out exactly why this happens, please send me e-mail!
