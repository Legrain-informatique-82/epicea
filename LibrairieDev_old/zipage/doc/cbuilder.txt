
            Notes Regarding C++ Builder 

This is a summary of some C++ Builder v1.xx problems 
and work-arounds.  Thanks to Alan Hendricks for his 
help on compiling this list.

1. Before installing the ZipMaster VCLs, make sure
   your compiler settings are OK.  I recommend that
   you use the settings at the end of this file.
   Also, make sure that the \ZIP\VCL subdir is added
   to your VCL library path AND to your include path.
      After configuring the IDE options, exit from it
   and restart it (to ensure that the new options are
   put into effect).

2. On WinNT, the Borland integrated debugger (in
   both Delphi and C++ Builder) will sometimes act as
   though it hit a breakpoint in the DLL.  You may see
   an error regarding the RTL freeHeap.  This is only
   a problem when debugging - it does not pose a
   problem if run outside of the IDE.

3. For some odd reason, the Borland-generated *.cpp
   files will show a specific path to the Zip DLLs, even
   though my code never specifies a specific path.  For
   example:

        USEFILE("\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\Zipdll.dll");
        USEFILE("\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\Unzdll.dll");

   Even though the paths are specified in this manner,
   they are apparently ignored.  Some people do not
   have a \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory, but there is still
   no problem locating the DLLs (which can be in the
   project directory or the real system dir).

   Just ignore the paths that you see for the DLLs
   in any of the code generated by C++ Builder.

4. I have noticed some instability in the code that
   builds the VCL library for version 1 of CBuilder.
   This is a manageable problem as long as you are
   aware of it.

   You must always keep a good copy of your component
   library on a floppy disk (or another hard disk
   directory) for safe keeping.  Sometimes, problems
   during the build of the VCL library can cause it
   to be corrupted, which then prevents CBuilder from 
   even starting.

   The Component Library file is named "CMPLIB32.CCL"
   and it is in the "bin" subdirectory under the main
   CBuilder directory.
  
   If the component library becomes corrupted, restore
   your good copy of "CMPLIB32.CCL", and delete these
   temporary files in that directory: CMPLIB32.I* and
   CMPLIB32.TDS.  Now, go back into CBuilder and
   fix the problem that caused the library to become
   corrupted.
       

==================================================
Recommended Configuration Settings in C++ Builder 
to compile Delphi VCLs.  This is general advice
and NOT a requirement.


Under Options:
   Environment:
      Preferences:
         Compiling:
            Cache hdrs on startup = unchecked(off). 
         Library:
            Show Hints = Off
            Show Warnings = Off
            Build with debug info = Off
            Link with debug VCL = Off

Under Options:
   Project:
      Linker:
         Link debug version of VCL = Off
         Use dynamic RTL = Off
