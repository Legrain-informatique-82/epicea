This package has 2 VCLs:

  TCopyFile - a wrapper around general file copy operations.

  TMyBackup - designed specifically to copy files to floppy 
              disks.  Supports automatic use of more than 1
              floppy disk for very large files.


I am not the author of these programs. I am only including them 
with Delphi Zip to help those people who have asked me how to break
up a large zip file and copy it to floppy disks.  This code will 
help you.

Sorry, but I don't have any instructions or demo programs for
this code.  If you write a good demo program, please e-mail me a copy!
